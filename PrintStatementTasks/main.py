#1. Basic String Output
#One of the simplest ways to output or print a message to the terminal.
print("Hello World!")

#2. Simple Math Inside Print
#I have learned that a print statement can also be used to perform arithmethic operations on integers as seen below.
print(10 + 2)

#3. I have also learned that Multiple Arguments in Print are possible by separating the arguments with a comma as seen below.
print("Python", "is", "awesome!")


#4. I have also learned that Print with Escape Characters can be used to output special characters like a quotation mark on the terminal as seen below.
print("He said, \"Hi!\"")

#5. I have also learned that Newline Character can be printed by using the \n to separate messages by line
print("First line\nSecond line")

#6. I have also learned that Tab Characters are made possible by using \t.
print("Item 1\titem2\titem3")

#7. I have also learned(I thought it was impossible) that Print Multiple Data Types Together is made possible by just using a comma!ðŸ˜®
print("The result is", 50)

#8. Print a Single Number is also possible by simply inputting the numbers and not engulfing them with quotation marks.
print(54321)

#9. Print a Decimal Number is also possible by just inputting the decimal numbers without putting quotation marks between them.
print(3.14)

#10. Print Special Characters can also be done by inputting whatever you want to output inside the quotation marks.
print("Peso sign: â‚±")

#11. Using the sep Parameter can be done by using commas and whatever you want to separate the arguments with inside the double quotation marks after "sep=". This was very new to me.
print("apple", "banana", "cherry", sep=",")

#12. Using the end Parameter can be used like the one below. It just separates arguments by using end= and the thing inside that is placed after the argument before end= is placed after the argument before end=
print("Hello,",end=" ")
print("World!")

#13. Print a Repeated String can also be done by using * and put how many times you want the message to be repeated.
print("Python! " * 3)

#14. Print a Unicode Character can be used by inputting whatever unicode character you want to output inside the double quotation marks by typing their unicode as seen below.
print("\U0001F4BB") # Prints a computer symbol

#15. Print Empty Line can be achieved by typing print() without putting anything inside those (). This can be used to provide space at your output terminal.
print()

#16. Concatenating Strings Inside is used to combine 2 or more strings by using the plus symbol.
print("Hello " + "World!")

#17. Print Boolean Values can be done by typing True or False inside the print statement.
print(True)
print(False)

#18. Printing Exponential Notation can also be done and used to output exponents and their notations. I think this is used to add zeroes after a number.
print(2e3)

#19. Print Multiline Text Using Triple Quotes can be done by using triple quotes to make multiline statements.
print("""This is a multiline 
Print Statement yo.""")

#20. Print Using Escaped Backslash can be done by copying the below statement.
print("This is a backslash: \\")
